== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the feature to *set and check user's email* and then *send reminder email commands*
** What it does: allows the user to set his email and check his email for the app, and use this email to send reminder emails to the customers.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users are able to send reminder emails with only one command instead of typing the whole emails by themselves.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in future and the sustainability of the app. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
** Credits: The send reminder email command is supported by https://github.com/javaee/javamail[JavaMail] library. Email connection and content generating codes are reused from https://github.com/clk528/maven-spring/blob/master/src/main/java/com/clk/library/sendmail.java[sendEmail].

* *Minor enhancement*: added censoring function in Nric, Phone and Email class to enable hiding sensitive information feature in LoanCard UI.
